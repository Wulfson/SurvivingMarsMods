I feel that someone who is unable to supress their desire for Luxury or Gambling should be weeded out during the vetting process to see who gets on that first ship.\r\n\r\nThis mod makes it so none of your Founders will look for Luxury or Gambling services during the \"Is your colony viable?\" period. Now, during those first 10 Sols (or until someone has a kid), you don't have to worry about your colonists quitting their jobs and demanding to take the next flight off this rock because Mars didn't have as many Casinos as they were expecting.",
